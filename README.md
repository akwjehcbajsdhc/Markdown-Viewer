# I've recently gotten into league, but I have one problem, how do I tell what damage my primary fire does?

For example Elise, do both her forms use magic or melee? What exactly is ability damage, is that just a way of saying magic damage or is it specifically to buff the abilities? It's really confusing because I need to know if I'm buffing my primary shooting.

## Damage Types and How They're Reduced
Physical damage is reduced by the armor stat.

Magic damage is reduced by the magic resistance stat.

True damage ignores most damage modifying effects and isn't reduced by armor or magic resistance; the number shown on the tooltip will be the damage it deals.

> *Ignite* is a spell that deals true damage.
>
> *Exhaust* is a spell that reduces the target's damage, but it won't reduce true damage.


## Damage Sources

Damage comes from a champion in two different ways.

- Basic attacks are what you're referring to with a champion's "primary shooting". Every champion has a basic attack and it almost exclusively deals physical damage.

- Ability damage is damage done by your champion's abilities (passive, Q, W, E, R). It can deal physical, magic, or true damage depending on the ability.

Whether an ability does magic damage like Elise Q or physical damage like Miss Fortune Q, it will trigger ability effects regardless of type.

> *Rylai's Crystal Scepter* is an item that allows your champion to slow units they deal ability damage to, but it won't work on basic attacks. 

## Damage Modifiers and Scalings

Elise is mage champion where all of her abilities including her passive deal exclusively magic damage.

While she still has a basic attack that deals physical damage and can be increased with the attack damage stat, she is better off using the ability power stat to increase the magic damage dealt by her abilities. As a mage, she is designed to cast spells this way.


### How abilities scale

Abilities scale with various stats, mostly <span style="color:#2471A3">ability power</span> or <span style="color:#F39C12">attack damage</span>, to modify their values. 

> Annie's Q ability, *Disintegrate*, deals magic damage to a target enemy equal to 70 <span style="color:#2471A3">(+75% AP)</span>. The more <span style="color:#2471A3">ability power</span> Annie gets, the more damage her Q will deal. 
>
> Jarvan's W ability, *Golden Aegis*, grants him a shield that blocks an amount of incoming damage, equal to 60 <span style="color:#F39C12">(+70% AD)</span>. The more <span style="color:#F39C12">attack damage</span> Jarvan gets, the more damage his basic attacks will deal *and* his W will shield him for more.

Abilities can interact with stats in unique ways, and it will be different for every champion. 

### What stats should I build?

For newer players, the item shop has recommendations on which items to build for your champion, but as you learn the game you will start to understand why each champion prefers different items.

Most damage-oriented champions are forced into either an <span style="color:#2471A3">ability power</span> or <span style="color:#F39C12">attack damage</span> build, as they scale more efficiently with one stat more than the other (if at all). However, some champions are hybrids in the sense they can effectively use both stats. Ezreal, Kai'sa, Smolder, and Twisted Fate, are some champions where their abilities can scale with both <span style="color:#2471A3">ability power</span> or <span style="color:#F39C12">attack damage</span>.

> Ezreal's E ability, *Arcane Shift*, deals magic damage equal to 80 <span style="color:#2471A3">(+75% AP)</span> <span style="color:#F39C12">(+50% AD)</span>.

It's all about what your champion can do with any given stat. Some champions like Varus and Udyr can build 90% of the items in League of Legends and be effective. 

### Damage scaling =/= Damage type

Just because an ability scales with <span style="color:#2471A3">ability power</span>, doesn't mean it deals magic damage, and vice versa.

> Lee Sin's E ability, *Tempest* deals *magic damage* equal to 35 <span style="color:#F39C12">(+100% AD)</span>.

Champions are capable of dealing a mix of both physical and magic damage with their abilities.
